# PCB-design-with-Allegro

* A PCB mechanically supports and electrically connects components using paths etched into sheets of copper laminated into/on layers of substrate.
* PCB types -> Single Layer, Multilayer, Rigid, High Frequency, etc.

* Layers of PCB

- Substrate layer (Fibreglass usually, Kapton)
- Copper layer ( Thickness depends on pwer requirements )
- Solder mask layer (Gold->best)
- Silkscreen layer (Prints for our undertsanding)

* Multilayer PCBs

PCB tech->

* Through-hole or Surface mount
* Signal traces are thinner than power traces
* In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as aground planefor shielding and power return.

* Silkscreen!

* Solder mask!

Solder mask is a thin layer of polymer that isput on a circuit board to protect the copper from oxidation and shorts during operation. It also protects the PCB from environmental influences such as dust and several other contaminants that may lead to shorts in the long run.It is due to the solder mask, which protects the copper circuits printed on the fiber glass core to prevent short circuits, soldering errors, etc. The color of the solder mask gives the board its appearance.


* Reference designator!

A reference designator unambiguously identifies a component within an electrical schematic or on a printed circuit board. The reference designator usually consists of one or two letters followed by a number, e.g. R13, C1002

* Netlist!

The netlistcontains the electrical connections between the components on the circuit board, and is usually held in textual format (see EDIF). In printed circuit board production a netlist (generated from the production data) is used to carry out an electrical test (E-test) to find incorrect or missing connections
